# Hong Kong Hotspots Closed Route Simulator with Excel Solver

## Description

This project aims to solve the typical traveling salesman problem (TSP) using linear programming techniques with the help of Excel Solver. The TSP involves finding the shortest closed route that visits a set of hotspots in Hong Kong. By utilizing Excel Solver, this simulator provides an efficient solution for planning optimal routes and minimizing travel distances.


## Features

1. Automated route generation: The simulator takes a list of hotspots in Hong Kong as input and generates an optimized closed route that visits each hotspot exactly once.
2. Distance calculation: The simulator calculates the total travel distance for the generated route, providing valuable insights into the efficiency of the solution.
3. Excel Solver integration: The project leverages Excel Solver, a powerful optimization tool, to solve the TSP and find the optimal route.
4. Sensitivity analysis: The simulator also provides sentivity analysis layer for both forward selection and backward selection.
5. User-friendly interface: The simulator provides an intuitive interface, allowing users to easily input the list of hotspots and visualize the generated route.


## Requirements

1. Installation of Excel Solver
2. Input dataset for target set of hotspots, in term of time cost and monetary cost for transpotation.
